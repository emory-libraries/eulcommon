EULcommon
=========

EULcommon is a `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ module with a few
small utilities that might be useful to others, but were not large or
significant enough to warrant splitting out into their own
repositories at this time.  These components may be broken out at a
later date.

**eulcommon.binfile** provides the capability to map arbitrary binary
data into a read-only python object.

**eulcommon.djangoextras** consists of a small number of extensions
and add-ons for use with `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_,
such as custom auth decorators, additional form fields, and additional
HTTP responses.
