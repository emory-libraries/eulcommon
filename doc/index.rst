EULcommon
=========

EULcommon is a collection of common Python libraries in use at `Emory
University Libraries <http://web.library.emory.edu/>`_. It's a bit
miscellaneous: The libraries are collected together primarily to minimize
proliferating many tiny projects. In future releases individual subpackages
may be split out as they mature.
