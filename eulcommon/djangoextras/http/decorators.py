def content_negotiation(formats, default_type='text/html'):
    """
    Provides basic content negotiation and returns a view method based on the
    best match of content types as indicated in formats.

    :param formats: dictionary of content types and corresponding methods
    :param default_type: string the decorated method is the return type for.

    Example usage::

        def rdf_view(request, arg):
            return RDF_RESPONSE

        @content_negotiation({'application/rdf+xml': rdf_view})
        def html_view(request, arg):
            return HTML_RESPONSE

    The above example would return the rdf_view on a request type of
    ``application/rdf+xml`` and the normal view for anything else.

    Any :class:`django.http.HttpResponse` returned by the view method chosen
    by content negotiation will have a 'Vary: Accept' HTTP header added.

    **NOTE:** Some web browsers do content negotiation poorly, requesting
    ``application/xml`` when what they really want is ``application/xhtml+xml`` or
    ``text/html``.  When this type of Accept request is detected, the default type
    will be returned rather than the best match that would be determined by parsing
    the Accept string properly (since in some cases the best match is
    ``application/xml``, which could return non-html content inappropriate for
    display in a web browser).
